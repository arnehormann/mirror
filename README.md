Mirror
============
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/arnehormann/mirror.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/arnehormann/mirror)
Make unsafe code safer by seeing it in the mirror.

This branch of [mirror](https://github.com/arnehormann/mirror) only contains the tag generator used to create `tags.go`. The file is generated because it contains tedious repetitions that simply should not be written by hand.

If you need to change tags.go, this is the right place for you. Otherwise, please switch to the [master branch](https://github.com/arnehormann/mirror).
